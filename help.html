      <p>
        Welcome to the help page for <span class="blue">Join</span>, your guide
        to using our kanban project management tool. Here, we'll provide an
        overview of what <span class="blue">Join</span>
        is, how it can benefit you, and how to use it.
      </p>
      <h2 class="mb24">What is Join?</h2>
      <p>
        <span class="blue">Join</span> is a kanban-based project management tool
        designed and built by a group of dedicated students as part of their web
        development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie. <br /><br />
        Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective
        method to visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize
        efficiency (or flow). <span class="blue">Join</span> leverages the
        principles of kanban to help users manage their tasks and projects in an
        intuitive, visual interface. <br /><br />
        It is important to note that <span class="blue">Join</span> is designed
        as an educational exercise and is not intended for extensive business
        usage. While we strive to ensure the best possible user experience, we
        cannot guarantee consistent availability, reliability, accuracy, or
        other aspects of quality regarding <span class="blue">Join</span>.

      <h2 class="mb24">How to use it</h2>
      <p>
        Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use
        <span class="blue">Join</span>:

            <h3 class="mt0">Exploring the Board</h3>
            <p>
              When you log in to <span class="blue">Join</span>, you'll find a
              default board. This board represents your project and contains
              four default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await feedback” and
              "Done".
            </p>

            <h3 class="mt0">Creating Contacts</h3>
            <p>
              In <span class="blue">Join</span>, you can add contacts to
              collaborate on your projects. Go to the "Contacts" section, click
              on "New contact", and fill in the required information. Once
              added, these contacts can be assigned tasks and they can interact
              with the tasks on the board.
            </p>

            <h3 class="mt0">Adding Cards</h3>
            <p>
              Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards.
              Cards represent individual tasks. Click the "+" button under the
              appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the task details in
              the card, like task name, description, due date, assignees, etc.

            <h3 class="mt0">Moving Cards</h3>
            <p>
              As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that
              on the board by dragging and dropping the card from one list to
              another.
            </p>

          <div>
            <h3 class="mt0">Deleting Cards</h3>
            <p>
              Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done"
              list or delete it. Deleting a card will permanently remove it from
              the board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as this
              action is irreversible.
